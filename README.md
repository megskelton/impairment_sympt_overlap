The project uses data from the [Genetic Links to Anxiety and Depression (GLAD) Study](https://gladstudy.org.uk/). The GLAD Study data are available via a data request application to the [NIHR BioResource](https://bioresource.nihr.ac.uk/using-our-bioresource/academic-and-clinical-researchers/apply-for-bioresource-data/). The data are not publicly available due to restrictions outlined in the GLAD Study protocol and specified to participants during the consent process. A specific data freeze is available including the variables specific to this project; email gladstudy@kcl.ac.uk for details.
